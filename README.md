# Lambda with PHP runtime environment

### Installation
First configure your iam user in AWS Console and give him `iam-policy.json` policy.

Create required AWS resources in console:

- S3 bucket
- DynamoDB table

Configure .env with Access Key and Secret, S3 bucket DynamoDB and rest

Install serverless framework that will give you nice set of tools to control your lambda function
```
npm install -g serverless
```

Deploy your first lambda function with php runtime environment
```
sls deploy
```

Invoke function through command line
```
sls invoke -f hello
```

Remove function, s3, cloudformation stack, logs
```
sls remove
```

#### Docker env
This repository is using [dev-env-client](https://github.com/apapala/dev-env-client) and [dev-env-host](https://github.com/apapala/dev-env-host) 

Configure `docker/php/hosts.conf`, `docker-compose.yml` and `serverless.yml` 

Start with
```
docker-composer up
```
And then visit [projectname.local](http://projectname.local) in your browser

### Debugging

Bootstrap and binaries files must be executable

`Cannot delete entity, must detach all policies first` error while `sls remove`?
You have probably added some policy to autogenerated lambda role,  

### Compiling PHP
It is best to do it on EC2 instance, as this will be exact environment that lambda will be using. 
Run EC2 instance and execute script `./layer/bin/compile-php.sh`. # Once make is done, copy php library from `~/php-7-bin/bin/php` to your project using scp or any other method.
